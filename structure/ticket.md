# Ticket System Best Practices

## 1. Service Layer Pattern
- Create a `TicketService` class to handle business logic
- Keep controllers thin and delegate complex operations to services
- This makes the code more maintainable and testable


## 3. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- Create DTOs for ticket creation and updates
- This ensures data validation before it reaches the service layer
- Makes the code more type-safe and maintainable

## 4. Events and Listeners
- Use events for important ticket actions:
  - Ticket created
  - Ticket status changed
  - New reply added
  - Ticket assigned
- This allows for decoupled functionality like notifications

## 5. Validation Rules
- Create dedicated validation rules for tickets
- Separate validation logic from controllers
- Make rules reusable across different parts of the application

## 6. API Resources
- Create API resources for ticket responses
- Transform data consistently
- Include related data when needed

## 7. Policies
- Implement authorization policies
- Control who can:
  - Create tickets
  - View tickets
  - Update tickets
  - Delete tickets
  - Reply to tickets

## 8. Notifications
- Implement notification system for:
  - New ticket creation
  - Ticket updates
  - New replies
  - Status changes

## 9. Search and Filtering
- Implement search functionality
- Add filters for:
  - Status
  - Date ranges
  - Priority
  - Assigned users

## 10. Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed tickets
- Implement cache invalidation for updates
- Use cache tags for better management
